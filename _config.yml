# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hello my name is Corey Albight,  I am a father, husband, son, inventor, and friend.  
  I like solving difficult problems and researching in depth answers.  I like writing "howto's" and DIYs
  README.md'z and document inline because I am not fond on explaining things more than twice plus I am 
  not good at memorizing things.  I automate every aspect of my life because I know I will be tired
  tomorrow and rather everything flow on auto-pilot.  I write scripts that are searchable and content that is approriate for all
  ages. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
