**Software Engineer**
Acted in the capacity as a team leader and people manager for a team of 10. Created software pipelines, designed system architecture of both on-prem and hybrid systems off-prem within 3 cloud providers. Responsible for releasing and testing the capital one mobile application that allowed clients to manage their credit cards and banking information.

- Developed on the Capital One mobile platform using Android, NodeJS, Bash, Python, Liquid Mobile, which provided a one-stop validation environment for future Capital One applications.

- Increased software delivery by 50%, the result of using FastLane, Ruby, Python, Gradle, Bash, Jenkins, Java, and swift programming for best practices of expedited releases, for fast to market which included automation of validated tests.

- Managed a team of 13.
 • Coordinated with vendors, contractors, and executive personnel, to reduce costs and increase delivery of automation for products like: Capital one&#39;s mobile application, credit wise, and car loans.
- Served both the external and internal users / clients of the Capital One application. The servers 200+ consisted of both Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft servers. The server population which hosted virtual machines, containers, and microservices.

- Web server applications that used IIS, Apache, and Nginx. Proxy server applications such as squid, and internal application servers like Jenkins that were used to serve the mobile applications. Managed and supported all three platforms that hosted mobile (iOS, Android, Web) and various SDLC platform stages such as dev, staging, and production environments.

Main role was to keep documentation in order and continue to document all CI/CD processes with both JIRA and README.md within internal Github Enterprise.

AWS EC2, load balancing, VPCs, and Lambda were used in different regions. Supported developers and security teams for versioning and feature requests as well as troubleshooting / debugging.

Converted an entire MacOS server farm to a cloud managed service called Mac Stadium. Which was able to host Mac / Apple specific needs in regards to iOS (Swift) Xcode environment. That did load balancing between on and off-premises machines that consisted over 20,000 transactions each minute and was co-located in different regions of the world.

 Bash has always been the main language used for scripting, and python comes in 2nd. However after spending time on a front-end for newsletters to our clients and internal staff we used Jekyll which was ruby based and markdown language was it primary core.

Created scripts, cronjobs, from both scratch and I have also refactored premade scripts to accommodate O notation so that the runtimes were reduced and offered exceptions to errors.

Created a storage system, which kept an entire working copy of all solutions in production on Glacier and reduced our storage needs to$1 per terabyte per month. It assisted in the artifacts that would later be pushed into 3 regions and JFrog artifactory which also stored binaries and versioning of packages to ensure uptime met 99.999

 Terraform and Ansible were managed by a docker instance of Jenkins to push, refactor, and provision, as well as terminate / destroy environments.

Linux versions most used in position held wereUbuntu, Archlinux, and CentOs.

Office 365 Migration from and to the cloud using powershell or any other functional scripting language available

Create simple to medium web applications in Ruby, and PHP to allow staff, clients, and executives to utilize automation of web services to eliminate and reduce waste in regards to self-serve/ manual processes that can be fat fingered into data wrong.
 Setup routes, views, controllers within Ruby on Rails to host a command center of python tools called UlyssesOS
 Setup routers, switches and storage solutions that involved EMC, vmWare, and Cisco so that redundancy, and availability as well as constant delivery was available.
 Assisted users and other DevOps members with the education and the power of both Ansible and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Compute so that we could identify the best and most cost efficient way to do business.
 Docker containers, software delivery, and environmental stability was a strong focus in regards to constant integration of my personal and strength of my learning and delivery of code(python scripts for my branches), infrastructure(IaaS/SaaS solutions and satisfaction of my clients base).
 Responsible for creating and migrating, and managing both databases in MySQL, Microsoft SQL server 08 to Azure and AWS using tools like RDS and my recent introduction to MariaDB using (Global transaction Identifiers known as GTID because of its awesome performance and crash-free Transaction IDs; but with the replication issues with earlier versions of MySQL 5.1, however with mysqldump and delimited texts setting masters/slave so that the replication can be passed later using binary logging.

Functioned as a storage administrator from the smallest systems to the largest. Some of the systems mentioned are EMC Isilon and the OneFS system and being trained in their Massachusetts facility so that I could properly manage the MODUS cluster of over 18 nodes with over a total of 3 PB.

Used DirSync and Active Directory to establish a single sign on system with office365, by the means of creating a TXT record in the Internet DNS settings, added the federation services role, added a Server Certificate that was a wild card using a security bit length of 2048, then we were able to bind it to IIS, Once the Federation role is installed, we imported the certificate and provided the proper domain name. Finally gave it a service account associated with Office365, and finally installed the compatible versions of PowerShell to align itself with Sign-in Assistant, next opened up the PowerShell interface and gave the command Convert-MsolDomainToFederated –DomainName domain.com, next installed Dir Sync on a 32 bit Windows Server 2008 OS to avoid the 64 bit limitation the communication sets have in the Office365 console. Finally go back to Office365 and under management complete the wizard of Active Directory Synchronization. Next start the DirSync go through the wizard and wait for the AD to finish syncing. Ports needed for Federation are 443, 444,81. To switch the ports simply open powershell and using the commands you can specify any port you like: Set-ADFSProperties -HttpsPort 444, Set-ADFSProperties -HttpPort 81

Integrated shared keys, public keys, LDAP, kebross and LDAPs into AWS so that both Active directory and private keys could be used to access different levels of tokens, access, and policy.

 Step through code using tools/commands like: vi vim sed and awk commands.
 Established a clustered vdi solution for remote desktop users and clients to review cases and mange projects more effectively, while decreasing the need to maintain a helpdesk technician onsite, increasing the redundancy, and reducing the need to house extra hardware and lowering the total costs of ownership..
 Created Asterisk server that gave the complete company at LightSpeed affordable phone services (PBX) via an open source Centos 6.2 distro that all us to make and receive calls using SIP technology. I was able to setup extensions, rules, and the IVR for the main office. With the Centos driving the Asterisk Server, and the front end as FreePBX I was also able to calendar calling, automated calls and clean and clear reception.
 Implemented a ticket system called Spiceworks which is a free application used to monitor the network and gather assets to track both users and equipment that they use.
 Transferring roles of Active Sync, OWA and older traffic to current Hyper-V Exchange 2010 / Exchange 2007 VMs. Updating older 2003 Active Directory security to the newer and more robust AD of 2008 R2. This included the need to update schemas, and IIS 6 to 7. Then finally moving mailboxes with PowerShell scripts readily found on Google. Then move any other public folders as new information stores to prevent corruption of older system data.

Zenoss, Splunk, and Solarwinds strictly for network projects and SQL monitoring.  I used a bandwidth monitor known well as Network flow analyzer to locate throughput issues with data and transfer issues.  I was able to save my prior client thousands of dollars on consulting fees and instead of them buying a new 200k server with an additional SAN. I increased their IOPS by simply locating the bottle necks on the throughput and eliminated the need of purchasing additional equipment, using the graphical interfaces and alerting mechanisms for traffic to flow. I could easily troubleshoot and monitor all the systems without interruptions by enabling MPIO for EMC known as Power path and later on adding a ZENOSS / NAGIOS solution to replace the solarwinds package.
